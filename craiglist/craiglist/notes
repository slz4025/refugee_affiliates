Some of the Florida locations incorrectly mapped to iami, so changed it to
miami.
Also, got rid of all miami references except the Miami / Dade.
changed len(postings)-1 to len(postings)

Join all the houses together:
sed 1d houses*.csv > merged.csv
need to add header after

Run web-scrapper:
scrapy crawl craig -o houses[].csv -t csv &> log
